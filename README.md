# TKKB-design-r1
 TKm3d1a Keyboard design project, revision 1

MY first attempt at using Github for rev control and publishing of any/all files in KB design.

The Goal is a 60% ish keyboard design, no multiple layout support.  Exposed diodes, with a swapable MCU.

Possibly also add numpad support as I personally use the numpad often.  

Designed to use PCB mount MX style switches.
